# Similar photosynthetic trait adaptation to low light has been shown for
# Physocarpus cultivars (Zhang et al. 2016) and sweet pepper (Sui et al. 2012), more().
# Moreover, increases in chlorophyll content in shade have been detected across ecosystems,
# Chlorophyll greater in shade leaves for mahogany seedlings (Goncalves et al. 2001


Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency differed by 56% among Selaginella species 
(p < 0.001, F=9.21) and was broadly lower in swamp habitat types (p= 0.017, F=4.62). 
No effect of species or habitat type was detected with photosynthetic phosphorus use efficiency.
